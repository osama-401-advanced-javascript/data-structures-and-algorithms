## Singly Linked List

_To create a linked-list with four methods which are .insert(value), includes(value),toString(value),.append(value),.insertBefore(value, newVal), .insertAfter(value, newVal)._

## Challenge Description

**Write the following methods for the Linked List class:**

_Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance._

_Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a Boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list._

_Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List._

## Approach & Efficiency

for .insert(value) O(1) for .includes(value),.toString(value), O(n)

## API

_Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a Boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list._

_Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List._
