## Stacks and Queues

**Create a class for Stack and class for Queue with methods for adding, removing, and viewing a stack and a queue.**

### Challenge

```
- Create a Node class that has value stored in Node and pointer to next node.
- Create a Stack class and Queue class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
- Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
- Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
- Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
-Should raise exception when called on empty stack
- Define a method called isEmpty that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
```

### Approach & Efficiency

_Big O for methods will be O(1)_
