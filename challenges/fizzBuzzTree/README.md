## fizzBuzzTree

### Challenge-18

_Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument._

_Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:_

- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

### Approach & Efficiency

_Time O(n) Space O(1) The approach was to create node create Binary tree class with inOrder, preOrder, postOrder methods to create a tree_

_Time O(n) space O(1)The approach was to create BST class with add and contains methods to add values into the tree and chrck if values exist in the tree_
